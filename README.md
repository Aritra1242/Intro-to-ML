This was a summer project offered by Programming Club IIT Kanpur
There were 2 assignments
   1. In the first assn we had to plot various graphs and show correlation between various features(UP Crime Data Analysis)
   2. In the second assn we had to implement various ML Algorithms and predict the taxi out time of various airlines.
      We also had to find the algorithm which gave the least error in the prediction.(Taxi - out Time)
